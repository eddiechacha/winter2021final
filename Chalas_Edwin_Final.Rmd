## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, Data Import & Overview}
#converting to dates
#sp500_companies <- read_csv("data/all_stocks_5yr.csv")

#sp500_total <- read_csv("data/data_csv.csv")

#dividing the dates into chunks

#sp500_companies <- sp500_companies %>% 
#  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")

#sp500_total <- sp500_total %>% 
#  separate(Date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")

#write_rds(sp500_total, "data/processed/sp500_total.rds")
#write_rds(sp500_companies, "data/processed/sp500_companies.rds")

#company_names <- read_csv("data/constituents.csv")

#joining the companies data with the names data

#sp500_companies <- inner_join(sp500_companies, company_names, 
#                       c("Name" = "Symbol"))

#filtering out data that's not in our timespan

#sp500_companies <- sp500_companies %>%
#  filter(year >= 2013 | month >= 02) %>%
#  filter(year <= 2018 | month >= 02)

#sp500_total <- sp500_total %>%
#  filter(year >= 2013 | month >= 02) %>%
#  filter(year <= 2018 | month >= 02)

#write_rds(sp500_total, "data/processed/sp500_total.rds")
#write_rds(sp500_companies, "data/processed/sp500_companies.rds")

sp500_total <- read_rds("data/processed/sp500_total.rds")
sp500_companies <- read_rds("data/processed/sp500_companies.rds")

#checking to see that everything looks OK

sp500_companies %>%
  skimr::skim_without_charts()

#no missing values

sp500_total %>%
  skimr::skim_without_charts()

#some missing values - but only 10 total in the entire set.

#doing some graphs to see general trends in normality

ggplot(data = sp500_total, aes(x = SP500)) +
  geom_density()

#the S&P 500 as a whole is just slightly skewed

ggplot(data = sp500_companies, aes(x = close)) +
  geom_density()

#as expected, the individual company data is extremely skewed (it being 500 seperate companies, this is to be expected)

#the random company we'll be focusing on is AAL - American Airlines Group. 

aal_data <- sp500_companies %>%
  filter(Name == "AAL")
  
ggplot(data = aal_data, aes(x = close)) +
  geom_density()
```

## Setting the Model Up

```{r, Setting the Model Up}

#splitting the S&P 500 data

sp_data <- sp500_total %>%
  select(-c(year, month, day)) %>%
  mutate(SP500 = log(SP500))

sp_split <- sp_data %>%
  initial_split(prop = .8, strata = SP500)

sp_train <- training(sp_split)

sp_test <- testing(sp_split)

ggplot(data = sp_train, aes(x = SP500)) +
  geom_density()

#splitting the AAL data

aal_data <- sp500_companies %>%
  filter(Name == "AAL") %>%
  select(-c(year, month, day, Name, Name.y, Sector.x, Name.y.y, Sector.y)) %>%
  mutate(close = log(close))

aal_split <- aal_data %>%
  initial_split(prop = .8, strata = close)

aal_train <- training(aal_split)

aal_test <- testing(aal_split)

ggplot(data = aal_train, aes(x = close)) +
  geom_density()

#folding the data

sp_folds <- vfold_cv(sp_train, v = 5, repeats = 3)

aal_folds <- vfold_cv(aal_train, v = 5, repeats = 3)

sp_recipe <- recipe(SP500 ~ ., data = sp_train) %>%
#center and scaling
step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
step_scale(all_predictors())

#testing it out with prep (we would normally use fit)
prep(sp_recipe) %>%
  juice()
#if there was no basement log 0 made it into -Inf which may or may not be an issue

aal_recipe <- recipe(close ~ ., data = aal_train) %>%
#center and scaling
step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
step_scale(all_predictors())

#testing it out with prep (we would normally use fit)
prep(aal_recipe) %>%
  juice()
#if there was no basement log 0 made it into -Inf which may or may not be an issue

lm_model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")

sp_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(sp_recipe) %>%
  add_model(lm_model)

sp_fit <- fit_resamples(sp_workflow, sp_folds)

collect_metrics(sp_fit)

lm_model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")

aal_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(aal_recipe) %>%
  add_model(lm_model)

aal_fit <- fit_resamples(aal_workflow, aal_folds)

collect_metrics(aal_fit)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
